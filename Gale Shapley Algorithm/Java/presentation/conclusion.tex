	We did enjoy a lot, and learning Java and Django was a great experience in itself \pause \\
	We had chosen to drop the idea of Box2D and the 3 of us decided to rather do the \pause \\
	(Lab 10 + Lab 11) Pro Version project \pause \\
	We realised that Learning Python and Java would be of much more utility \pause \\
	It will be better to learn 2 highly popular programming languages \pause \\
	than just learning Box2D \pause \\
	Also, both of these languages are currently widely in use \pause \\
	So we decided that it was a better idea to learn python and java \pause \\

	Another important reason was the beauty of the problem statement of Lab 10 and 11 \pause \\
	The problem statement wanted us to create a real time working \pause \\
	web application which was indeed fascinating \pause \\
	We had just learnt the Gale - Shapley algorithm in our Discrete Structures \pause \\
	course and a project which required an implementation of a recently learnt \pause \\
	algorithm sounded pretty cool to us \pause \\
	Java is a highly user friendly language to work with \pause \\
	It is fast, and is also highly efficient with a number of standard libraries that ease our task \pause \\
	Similarly, python is very easy to work with  \pause \\
	Django framework is a bit difficult to understand but once understood well,  \pause \\
	It can be used to make a wide variety of powerful web applications \pause \\
	All in all, we learnt a lot and we look forward to many other such projects in future \pause \\
