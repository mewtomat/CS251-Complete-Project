	We created a web application that helps a candidate to fill his/her choices for JEE counselling. \pause 
	We also created a program in java that takes into account the preferences of students and the merit lists of the colleges \\
	in order to best allocate seats. \pause
	
	This report is made through beamer which is a very useful tool. It is much more powerful than other presentation softwares such as MS Power Point. \pause
	There are many predefined templates , which can be applied very easily, and make the presentation attractive and interactive.\pause
