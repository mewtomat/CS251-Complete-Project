This is our final submission for box2d. We have selected Seat allocation as our final project. Thus the box2d version submitted here is till the stage which was completed before we decided to select Seat allocation as our final choice.
The final report can be generated by typing: "$ make mainReport" This compiles the tex file Latex Report.tex to generate Latex Report.pdf.
The documentation can be generated by typing "$ make doc" . This generates doxyfile documentation in the folder ./doc/html.
The executable can be found in mybins directory.
The beamer report on the physics of Box2d can be generated by "$ make report". This generates main.pdf in report directory. This report was done as a part of previous lab. However, due to its relevance to the project, we have decided to include it in the final submission too.
