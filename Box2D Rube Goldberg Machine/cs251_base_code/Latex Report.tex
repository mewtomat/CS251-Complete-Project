\section{Why a Project ?}
\hspace*{5 mm}Software Systems lab is a course which is meant to explore all sorts of softwares \\
\hspace*{5 mm}The idea is to cover a wide range of softwares which will surely help us to command respect over  \\
\hspace*{5 mm}non - CS majors \\
\hspace*{5 mm}But that is a secondary reason \\
\hspace*{5 mm}The primary reason is to experience computer science - to experience learning - to experience \\
\hspace*{5 mm}exploring! \\
\hspace*{5 mm}The project is meant to teach us "team - work" and collaboration \\
\hspace*{5 mm}\\
\section{What's there in it ?}
\hspace*{5 mm}This project aims at making a Rube Goldberg Machine in the Box2D environment \\
\hspace*{5 mm}We intend to create a Rube Goldberg machine simulation in the Box2D platform \\
\hspace*{5 mm}The idea is to use the inbuilt physics provided by the Box2D physics engine to demonstrate a \\
\hspace*{5 mm}Rube Goldberg Machine \\
\hspace*{5 mm}It will contain several moving objects which will follow the laws of Physics provided by Box2D \\
\hspace*{5 mm}There will be balls, dominos, moving planks, and other interesting objects, including ropes and \\
\hspace*{5 mm}candles \\
\hspace*{5 mm}The idea is to learn to implement both physics and graphics in the traditional language : C++ \\
\hspace*{5 mm}We have been working on this project since past 1 month or so and we learnt a lot in due course \\
\hspace*{5 mm}of time \\
\section{Project Credits : }
\hspace*{5 mm}The following people were involved in the development of this project : \\
\\
\hspace*{10 mm}1.) Anmol Arora (Roll number 130050027) : Worked mainly on suggesting ideas \\
\hspace*{10mm} + the coding part (pendulums) \\
\hspace*{10 mm}2.) Pranjal Khare (Roll number 130050028) : Worked mainly on developing svg \\
\hspace*{10mm} + the coding part (cavity) \\
\hspace*{10 mm}3.) Aman Goel (Roll number 130050041) : Worked mainly on developing LaTeX report \\
\hspace*{10mm} + the coding part (the lower part) \\
\section{Project Time Line : }
\hspace*{5 mm}The problem statement of the project was released by the end of August 2014 \\
\hspace*{5 mm}We started to work on it soon after it was released \\
\hspace*{5 mm}The work was at it's peak in the middle of September \\
\hspace*{5 mm}But soon we had to slow it down because of Mid semester examinations \\
\hspace*{5 mm}The project work again took pace after the Mid semester examinations were over \\
\section{Experience with the project : }
\hspace*{5 mm}Our schedule is usually very hectic and additionally we got a project work \\
\hspace*{5 mm}So we were indeed tensed \\
\hspace*{5 mm}But the team contains very efficient planners who know how to manage things well \\
\hspace*{5 mm}So we used to plan and sit together for our project work \\
\hspace*{5 mm}Regular planning and skilled management ensured a steady progress in the project \\
\hspace*{5 mm}We did face a number of difficulties \\
\hspace*{5 mm}For example, the pendulum part was really confusing \\
\hspace*{5 mm}It was here that the website www.stackoverflow.com proved to be a boon for us \\
\hspace*{5 mm}We used to used Google a lot for any sort of help \\
\hspace*{5 mm}Box2D was a new platform to work with. So we were bound to get stuck \\
\hspace*{5 mm}But, in the end, we did get solutions to our problems \\
\section{Conclusion : }
\hspace*{5 mm}We did enjoy a lot, and learning Box2D was a great experience in itself \\
\hspace*{5 mm}But, we chose to drop the idea of Box2D and the 3 of us decided to rather do the \\
\hspace*{5 mm}(Lab 10 + Lab 11) Pro Version project \\
\hspace*{5 mm}We realised that Learning Python and Java would be of much more utility \\
\hspace*{5 mm}It will be better to learn 2 highly popular programming languages \\
\hspace*{5 mm}than just learning Box2D \\
\hspace*{5 mm}Also, both of these languages are currently widely in use \\
\hspace*{5 mm}So we decided that it was a better idea to learn python and java \\
\hspace*{5 mm}Another important reason was the beauty of the problem statement of Lab 10 and 11 \\
\hspace*{5 mm}The problem statement wanted us to create a real time working web application \\
\hspace*{5 mm}which was indeed fascinating \\
\hspace*{5 mm}We had just learnt the Gale - Shapley algorithm in our Discrete Structures \\
\hspace*{5 mm}course and a project which required an implementation of a recently learnt \\
\hspace*{5 mm}algorithm sounded pretty cool to us \\
\hspace*{5 mm}All in all, we learnt a lot and we look forward to many other such projects in future \\
