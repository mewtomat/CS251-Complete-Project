	\frametitle{The Purpose of this Report}
	We identified the "behind the scenes" equations which are used for simulation by Box2D.\pause In this report we have identified three physical phenomenon which are 
	involved in the rube goldberg simulation. \pause \\
	We have tried to describe the equations  and point out the specific occurences of the corresponding physical phenomenon in our simulation\pause \\
	
	This report is made through beamer which is a very useful tool. It is much more powerful than other presentation softwares such as MS Power Point. \pause
	There are many predefined templates , which can be applied very easily, and make the presentation attractive and interactive.\pause
